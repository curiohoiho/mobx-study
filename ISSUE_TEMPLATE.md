Welcome to MobX. Please provide as much relevant information as possible!

I have a*:

1. [ ] Question. Feel free to just state your question :) For a quick answer, there are usually people online at our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mobxjs/mobx) channel
2. [ ] Issue. Please make sure you have the following:
  * [ ] Did you check this issue wasn't filed before?
  * [ ] What is your issue? Why do you thing this is not the expected behavior?
  * [ ] What MobX version(s) are you using? Which browser / node / ... version?
  * [ ] Where can we find an isolated reproduction of your problem? A reproduction is mandatory for most issues.
3. [ ] Idea
  * [ ] What problem would it solve for you?
  * [ ] Do you think others will benefit from this change as well?
  * [ ] Are you willing to (attempt) a PR yourself? (a javascript fork based on `npm run quick-build` is OK as well)
  * [ ] Are you willing to provide unit tests?
  * [ ] Are you willing to update the docs?

Please tick the appropriate boxes. Feel free to remove the other sections.
